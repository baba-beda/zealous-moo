This film was directed by Mike Leigh, and its script was as well written by him. Stunning David Thewlis (Johnny) played the protagonist, the extremely clever and fairly unhappy person. Main women characters were presented by Lesley Sharp as Louise and Katrin Cartlidge as Sophie.
This story took place in capitalistic London at the end of XXth century. But firstly we are introduced with protagonist violently raping the lady at the street of Manchester. Then he escaped from Manchester to London, where lived his ex-girlfriend Louise. He entered Louise's house while she was at work, so he accidentaly met Sophie, her housemate. The further story would be about and actually around these three people.
The whole film Johnny was walking around London, stopped here and there, with different people, and different women, stealing their books. And it surprising, but everybody of people he met opened and naked their soul, fears and unhappiness to him.
My feelings after this film were quite mixed, because it's really obscure, and it touches deep strings of soul. So this story about miserable man, who didn't find himself in that industrial and capitalistic world, who just expressed his awful sadness about the world and about himself in violence to women during the sex. So these naked and miserable people incredibly terify me, because this way of life is opposite to mine. But I know that even inside really happy person dark and sad feelings hide.
