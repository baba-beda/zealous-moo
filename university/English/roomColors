bedroom:
    ceiling: smooth glossy jet-black with tiny starts, than wonderfully reflects the light
    walls: light grayish blue, so it makes beautiful contrast with ceiling
    woodwork: i don't really colors and textures that usually represents wood, so only woodwork that I'd have in my bedroom (shelves, armchair, coffee table) must be milky colour(#fbfbfa)
    carpet: i really like red colours for floor, so maybe it's better for me to have deep red carpet with long fringe
    curtains: curtains must be heavy and solid, better dark. so i prefer strong blue colour for them

kitchen: kitchen is the second room that i'd visit in the morning after bathroom. so it must charge me with positive energy for the rest of the day.
    ceiling: glossy pure white, i'd like to have as much colour as i can
    walls: i'd like to have multi-coloured bright walls, with tiny ornaments
    woodwork: mat pure white
    tiles: maybe i'd like to have grassy green floor, so it can be similar to grass but more convenient to clean, and surely it must have warming, because tiles are easy to cool
